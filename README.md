## About The Project
![Screenshot (1009)](https://github.com/ShivaBhattacharjee/SSO/assets/95211406/d872a750-4fa9-4a31-8a13-71f859ab8cf9)

SSO is a Single Sign-On (SSO) system that allows users to seamlessly authenticate across multiple applications using a single set of credentials. Built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS, SSO offers a secure and efficient way to manage user authentication.

## Built With

SSO is built using:

* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> is a distributed version control system used for software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, keeping track of changes and managing versions. It also enables users to revert changes and collaborate more effectively.

<a href="https://bun.sh/">BunJS</a> is a JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner, and bundler built from scratch using the Zig programming language. It was designed by Jarred Sumner as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. Bun uses WebKit's JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine, unlike Node.js and Deno, which both use V8.
